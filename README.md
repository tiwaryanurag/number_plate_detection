# Number plate detection system
(In development)

## Description
Utilizing Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and OpenCV, our Vehicle Number Plate Detection system extracts license plate information from real-time footage with precision. Integrated with MongoDB for efficient data storage, this solution offers seamless scalability and data management. Powered by Flask and pytesseract, our system provides a user-friendly interface for accessing and analyzing vehicle data, ensuring efficient monitoring and management of traffic and security systems.
